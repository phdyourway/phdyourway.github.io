## About

PhD Your Way is an online event in which

* Mathematics PhD life and applications will be explained
* PhD students will answer questions about maths PhD life
* Detailed information on a wide range of courses will be provided.

Final year undergraduates and masters students in mathematics from across the UK are invited to attend. If you have never previously considered pursuing research mathematics then this is a opportunity to understand the joys and challenges of studying for a maths PhD and how to apply for one.

This event is particularly aimed at groups currently under-represented within mathematics, and we are aiming to provide information for people from a diverse range of backgrounds.
