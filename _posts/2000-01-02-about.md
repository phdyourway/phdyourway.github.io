## About

PhD Your Way is an online event in which

* Mathematics PhD life and applications will be explained
* Detailed information on a wide range of courses will be provided
* PhD students from each participating university will be available to answer questions about maths PhDs at their institution and about PhD life in general

Mathematics masters students from across the UK are invited to attend. If you had never previously considered pursuing research mathematics then this is a opportunity to understand the joys and challenges of studying for a maths PhD and how to apply for one.

We particularly encourage participation from underrepresented groups within mathematics, and we will discuss PhD life for those from diverse backgrounds within the event.
