## About

* Mathematics masters students from across the UK are invited to attend an online event in which PhD life and applications will be explained, and detailed information on the wide range of courses available will be provided.
* If you had never previously considered pursuing research mathematics then this is an opportunity to understand the joys and challenges of studying for a maths PhD, and the practicalities of applying for one.
* At the end, PhD students from each participating university will be available to answer any of your questions about PhDs at their institution or about PhD life in general.
* We particularly encourage participation from underrepresented groups within mathematics, and we will discuss the nature of PhD life for those from diverse backgrounds within the event.
