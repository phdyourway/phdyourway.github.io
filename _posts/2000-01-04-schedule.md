## Schedule
 
In the week preceding the event, students will be given an information pack that gives details on mathematics PhDs at the participating universities (application deadlines, research groups, travel opportunities, seminars, events for underrepresented groups).

They will also have the opportunity to anonymously submit questions before and during the event to be answered in the panel discussion.

By attending this event you are agreeing to our <a href="img/CodeofConduct.pdf">Code of Conduct</a>.
